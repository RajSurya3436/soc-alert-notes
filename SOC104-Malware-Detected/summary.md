# SOC104 - Malware Detected

## Event Details
- **Event ID:** 36  
- **Event Time:** December 1, 2020, 10:23 AM  
- **Final Decision:** True Positive  
- **Rule Triggered:** SOC104 - Malware Detected  

## Investigation Summary
A suspicious file was submitted for static analysis using VirusTotal, which confirmed it to be malicious. The hash revealed multiple detections across several antivirus engines, categorizing the file under:

- Ransomware (Maze)  
- Trojan  
- Adware  

Further analysis linked the file to known malware families such as:

- Maze  
- Dump  
- GarrantDecrypt  

The file also attempted to connect to a known Command and Control (C2) server, indicating post-infection communication intent. This connection reinforces its classification as a high-risk file.

## Playbook Actions
- Verified malware hash using VirusTotal  
- Analyzed behavioral patterns and signature detections  
- Identified and confirmed C2 communication attempt  
- Verified that the malware was contained/quarantined to prevent lateral movement  

## Notes
Containment and isolation actions were initiated immediately upon detection.  
Due to the involvement of Maze ransomware and confirmed C2 activity, this case was treated with high severity.  
This event highlights the importance of quick analysis and isolation to avoid further impact.

## Verdict
- **Risk Level:** High  
- **Classification:** Confirmed Maze Ransomware Infection  
- **Response:** Contained, investigation documented, recommended continuous monitoring  

This investigation demonstrates end-to-end malware analysis and containment in a SOC context. Maze ransomware cases require rapid attention due to their encryption and extortion behavior.
